## Notebooks
### Exploring the address data
Exploration of the address dataset from BOSA. In this notebook we present the most common streetnames, the longest streetnames and the streets with the highest amount of houses.
### Address heatmap
We create a heatmap of all the addresses in Belgium, where brighter areas mean a higher density of addresses.
### Word Embeddings
Inspired by creatingdata.us/etc/streets/ we try to compute word vectors for each streetname and then visualize the relationship between streetnames.
